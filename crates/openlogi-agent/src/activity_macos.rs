//! The macOS host-activity levels behind the device-I/O gate.
//!
//! The gate exists to keep Logitech HID access off while the Mac is asleep or
//! in a DarkWake: opening a Bluetooth HID device during a maintenance wake is
//! what promoted an invisible wake into a lit external display (#656). That is
//! a question about the *system's* power state, and it is answered here from
//! power management itself rather than from AppKit.
//!
//! `NSWorkspace` cannot carry it. Its sleep/wake notifications are edges, the
//! screen-wake edge is not guaranteed on a lid-close/open cycle (Apple DTS,
//! developer forums thread 796109), and `NSWorkspaceDidWakeNotification` fires
//! for a DarkWake as well — so an edge-latched gate had no "the DarkWake is
//! over" signal and wedged shut whenever a wake notification was dropped
//! (#1281).
//!
//! `IOPMConnection`, the powerd client API `pmset` is built on, reports every
//! Sleep / DarkWake / FullWake transition as the complete capability set of
//! the new state, delivered over Mach to a dispatch queue this process owns,
//! and reads the current set on demand. Every input to the gate is therefore a
//! level: nothing has to pair, a missed event is corrected by the next, and no
//! timer is needed. Console ownership (fast user switching) is the other
//! level; its AppKit edges are forwarded from `tray`, and it is re-read from
//! CoreGraphics on every power transition.
//!
//! The API is exported by IOKit since 10.6 but declared only in Apple's
//! open-source `IOKitUser/pwr_mgt.subproj/IOPMLibPrivate.h`, hence the
//! hand-written `extern` block (`.claude/rules/objc-ffi.md`). When the
//! connection cannot be opened the gate follows the console alone and says so
//! at error level: a Mac without the SPI gets pre-0.8.2 behaviour — hardware
//! usable, #656 unprotected — not an agent that can never touch hardware.
